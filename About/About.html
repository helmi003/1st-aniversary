<p><span class="title">The Walking Dead </span>is an American post-apocalyptic horror television series for AMC based on the comic book series by Robert 
Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. The series features a large ensemble cast as survivors of a zombie apocalypse, trying 
to stay alive under near-constant threat of attacks from the mindless zombies, colloquially known as "walkers". However, with 
the fall of humanity, these survivors also face conflict from other living survivors who have formed groups and communities with
their own sets of laws and morals, often leading to hostile conflict between the human communities. Andrew Lincoln played the 
series's lead character, Rick Grimes, until his departure during the ninth season. Other long-standing cast members have 
included Norman Reedus, Steven Yeun, Chandler Riggs, Melissa McBride, Lauren Cohan, and Danai Gurira.</p>

<p>The series is exclusively broadcast on AMC in the United States and internationally through the Fox Networks Group. 
The series premiered on October 31, 2010. The tenth season premiered on October 6, 2019, and has been renewed for an eleventh 
season. AMC stated their intent to continue further development of the series and related media. A spinoff series Fear the 
Walking Dead premiered on August 23, 2015, and is renewed for a sixth season. A second spinoff, The Walking Dead: World Beyond,
is set to premiere in early 2020. AMC has announced plans for three films to follow Rick's story after Lincoln's departure.</p>

<p>The Walking Dead is produced by AMC Studios within the state of Georgia, with most filming taking place in the large outdoor 
spaces of Riverwood Studios near Senoia, Georgia. The series was adapted from the comic by Frank Darabont, who also served as 
the showrunner for the first season. However, conflicts between Darabont and AMC forced his departure from the series, and which
is currently subject to multiple lawsuits by Darabont and others. Following Darabont, Glen Mazzara, Scott M. Gimple, and 
Angela Kang have all served as showrunners.</p>
<p>Beginning with its third season, The Walking Dead has attracted the most 18- to 49-year-old viewers of any cable or broadcast
television series, though viewership has declined in later seasons. The series has been well received by critics, although 
reception has declined as the series has progressed.[3] It has been nominated for several awards, including the Writers Guild
of America Award for New Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series â€“ Drama.</p>
